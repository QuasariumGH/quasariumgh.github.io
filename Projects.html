                <p class ="Description">You're a test subject, placed in a world where your goal is to survive incoming waves of zombies. Every wave, the number of zombies increase which makes it much more difficult to survive. You are given 650 dollars to purchase a weapon of your choosing to defend yourself in this simulation. Your goal is to survive as long as you can and kill as many zombies as possible. The more zombies you kill, the more money you will earn, so you can obtain new weapons and specialties to use against them. (Keep in mind, this game is still in early development so please report any bugs or glitches if you can, thanks) This game was made in Unity 2020.2.2f1.</p>
